*Decentralized Identity Management System*

*Overview*
This project implements a decentralized identity management system using:

Shi-Tomasi corner detection for biometric fingerprint feature extraction.
Fuzzy Extractor for generating cryptographic keys from biometric data.
DID (Decentralized Identifier) Manager for creating and managing DIDs.
Solidity Smart Contract to securely store credentials on the blockchain.
Python for integrating these components and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
*Prerequisites*
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
Solidity Compiler (solc)
Ganache (or any other local Ethereum blockchain)
Node.js (for Truffle if you want to manage contracts with it)
Web3.py (Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)
OpenCV (for Shi-Tomasi corner detection)
Cryptography Library (for generating cryptographic keys)
